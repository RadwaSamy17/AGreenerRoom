# AGreenerRoom
* Web Project Using HTML&amp; CSS
This project is a web development exercise using HTML and CSS to recreate the website https://agreenerroom.com/. The aim of the project was to apply the concepts learned in the client-server course and practice web development skills. 

* The recreated website has similar functionalities and features as the original website, including navigation menu. The HTML and CSS code were written from scratch without using any pre-built templates or frameworks. The project provided the opportunity to learn and practice web design principles, layout, and styling, as well as client-server concepts.
